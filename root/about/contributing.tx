## MetaCPAN Needs You!

Our code base is based on current best practices and modern web technologies.
Our stack includes Catalyst, Minion, Plack, Elasticsearch, jQuery, Bootstrap
and NGINX.  We also use Puppet and Ansible for deployment and Docker for
development VMs.  We have integration with GitHub, PAUSE, and Google.
All code is managed on GitHub and we have an active channel (#metacpan) on
irc.perl.org.

There are many available projects within MetaCPAN which you could take on or
contribute to and there is also room for you to suggest improvements which you
would like to make.

The [wishlist](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api/wiki/Wishlist) contains
(larger) items that we want to 'get around to'.

A good first read is the "[How to contribute](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)" document.

## Source Code

MetaCPAN consists of [many projects](https://github.com/metacpan). The main
repositories are:

* Front end: [github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web) — this is what you are looking at right now.
* API: [github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api) — the back end REST API to data around CPAN and its ecosystem.
* Swagger docs: [api.metacpan.org/v1/static/index.html](https://api.metacpan.org/v1/static/index.html)
* Example scripts: [github.com/metacpan/metacpan-examples](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-examples)

## Bug Reporting

Bugs in the behaviour of this site can be reported at
[GitHub](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web). Feel free to post all bug
reports related to this web site and web service here. If your reports belong
in a different MetaCPAN project, we will happily move them to the right
location. If in doubt, open a new issue.

## Improve Search

metacpan.org already has workable search functionality, but it could be
improved a lot.  This is our main pain point.  We need help in the following
areas:

* Optimizing current searches so that they return results faster
* Improving the current search to return more relevant results
* Adding the ability to search on other things, like authors
* Including TRIAL releases in search results

You do not need to have any working knowledge of Elasticsearch in order to take
this on.  We are here to point you at the resources you need to be successful
with this.

## Bug Fixes

There are hundreds of outstanding issues waiting to be resolved.  The large
number of tickets is not indicative of a lack of response on the part of
MetaCPAN developers (we try to stay on top of them), but it indicates the
enthusiasm with which people are helping us track ways to improve.  Starting
with some open issues would be a good way to familiarize yourself with our
codebase.

## API Documentation

Because things traditionally have changed so rapidly, our documentation has
either not kept up or not been written to completion.  You can help us (and
many Perl developers) by documenting the API and posting example code for both
new and experienced MetaCPAN users.

## What Can We Offer You?

It's already clear from the materials above that there are many ways for you to
make your mark on MetaCPAN, but what can we offer you?  You will have the
chance to be mentored by experienced (and employed) Perl developers.  We will
carefully review all of your code and give you constructive (and kind)
feedback.  We will help you improve your code and your coding practices.
MetaCPAN is a positive place.   We will help you get from A to B with your
code, but your work won't be trashed and you won't be insulted. We value all
contributions and we want every contributor to know that she or he is
appreciated.  There are some harsh places on the Internet and in Open Source.
This is not one of them.

You'll have the chance to learn about the technologies as listed in our "stack"
above.  You will have help and guidance in working with these technologies from
people who are quite familiar with them.  Your code will deploy on robust
hardware (think 30+ GB of RAM).  Your code will often deploy within hours or
even minutes of being submitted.  Your work will immediately be put to the test
by our many users on our very busy services.  You'll gain experience in NoSQL
(Elasticsearch), Git, and also in participating in an Open Source project which
functions as a highly available web service.  You will gain experience not just
in writing code, but in participating in the full cycle of code deployment,
skills which are quite valuable in the real world.

If any of this sounds remotely interesting to you, please don't hesitate to get
in touch.  If you just want to see how you like the project, feel free to get
involved via GitHub, IRC or both.  We'll guide you through the process and you
can decide for yourself if it's a good fit for you.  We look forward to hearing
from you.
